## Version 1.0.0-alpha2

- fixed a bug where spells wouldn't be shown if the player wasn't in combat with the enemy themselves
- fixed a bug where some settings would apply to both party and self frames, despite only changing one of them
- fixed a bug leading to the inability of displaying the cast duration when using nameplate addons
  - thanks to plusmouse for suggesting to use an API that eluded me until then, `UnitCastingDuration` & `UnitChannelDuration`
- fixed a bug where the addon was incorrectly establishing whether the Combat Audio Assist - Say If Targeted setting was active on login
- changed the Edit Mode default position for Self in Midnight to the same as before Retail, slightly off-center

## Version 1.0.0-alpha1
